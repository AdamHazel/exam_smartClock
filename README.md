# About exam_smartClock
This was an exam project created by a group of students for their exam in Microcontrollers, taken in their second semester of the Software Engineering program offered by UiA Grimstad, Norway. The project was to create a smart clock using the STMicroelectronics B-L475E-IOT01A2 development board and Mbed OS. For a full description of functional requirements, see https://meowing-cantaloupe-813.notion.site/Exam-Requirements-1b9ab671636a8022ba92ea2825a66033?pvs=74.

## Reflections
Our professor was an ardent beliver in using C. Therefore, even though the project was written in C++, we concur that we have not utilized the power of C++ as well as we could. If we were to redo the project, we would also use well-established architectures rather than creating our own. On the other hand, implementing functionality was a fun endeavour, especially mapping out the state machine for the alarm clock. A better grasp in discrete mathematics would, however, allow us to create a more succint state machine and thus better implementation.
